I Really Don't Want To Know
Eddy Arnold


How many arms have held you
And hated to let you go
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know.

How many lips have kissed you
And set your soul aglow
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know.

So always make me wonder
Always make me guess
And even if I ask you 
Darling don't confess.

Just let it remain your secret
But darling I love you so
No wonder, no wonder I wonder
Though, I really don't want to know...
