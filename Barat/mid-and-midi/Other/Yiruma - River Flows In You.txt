Rivers Flow In You
(Yiruma)

You are just too young to find the
Senses in your life
Looking for something else like the
Dream that you have
Filled your life with something
Else like teardrop in your eyes
Who does care what you are while
The river flows in you?

You are not the fool, no
You're a beautiful one
You are like the sun
Cause this one river flows in you
You are not the no one
You just look for more here
Who does care because you are the one with it inside

You are not the fool, no
You're a beautiful one
You are like the sun
Cause this one river flows in you
You are not the no one
You just look for more here
Who does care because you are the one with it inside

You are just too young to find the
Senses in your life
Looking for something else like the
Dream that you have
Filled your life with something
Else like teardrop in your eyes
Who does care what you are while
The river flows in you?
