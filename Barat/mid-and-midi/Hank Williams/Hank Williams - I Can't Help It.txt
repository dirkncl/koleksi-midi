"I Can't Help It"
(originally by Hank Williams)

Today I passed you on the street and my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side and he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your heart and walked so close to you
Then suddenly I got that old time feeling I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you and hold you just the way I used to do
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss you I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
