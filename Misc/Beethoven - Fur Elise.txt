About "Beethoven: Fur Elise":
INTIMATE & ENIGMATIC, Beethoven wrote this tuneful classic in 1810
for Therese Malfatti, aka Elise. Today, it is his most popular piano piece
based on sheet music sales. After a repeated introduction of the pining
main theme, it alternates with two episodes of contrasting material.
The first is a brief lyrical passage, made even sunnier by the surrounding
dark moods. The second episode is an excited declaration over agitated
bass.
